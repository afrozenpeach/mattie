      Hi! I'm Mattie Schraeder, a transgender game designer, blogger, and
      software engineer from Springfield, IL. I came out as transgender January
      1st, 2017 and this blog is full of my thoughts on being transgender in the
      Midwest and on the Internet.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a game designer I signed my first board game, Heckin Hounds, to be
      published by Sapphire City Games and released on Kickstarter in 2021. I
      also work on the board of directors for the board game convention, Geekway
      to the West.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a software engineer I work on various projects in C#, Angular,
      JavaScript, and PHP. Most notably I created an editor for bibliography
      records called C# MARC Editor, and a Dungeons and Dragons Character Sheet
      Editor.
